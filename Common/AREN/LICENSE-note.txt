Files in this directory are not really part of M8M. They were borrowed from my internal "AREN Technology" project.
In terms of licensing, it doesn't change much to you. Consider them either MIT or ZLIB and you'll be fine - those files behave exactly like "original" files in M8M which implies you can do pretty much anything you want.

However, if you want to use a stricter license, please do not include those files in your project as I use them in a closed-source project.
The only thing I really want to do with this note is making clear I have the right to keep using it in a closed source project.
