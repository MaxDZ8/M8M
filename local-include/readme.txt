The ./rapidjson directory contains headers from RapidJSON, by Milo Yip et al.
It is a library for JSON parsing privileging efficiency over ease of use.
As M8M is very light on CPU, it is perhaps not the best choice in this case,
yet the library is sound, well designed and well mantained.
I like it's header only.

The headers here were pulled from the following commit
https://github.com/miloyip/rapidjson/commit/a5ffc5be1c32a0faf0ce647dda6c82212d58bc94

They are replicated here for your convenience but for every serious use,
hit rapidjson homepage and update.

Special thanks to Milo Yip and the rapidjson contributors.
