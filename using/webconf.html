	<h1>Web configurator</h1>
	It is very similar to the <a href="firstRun.html#configWizard">configuration wizard</a>. In fact, they are the same web app.<br>
	The configuration wizard is run if no file can be found. Otherwise, the configurator is run.<br>
	The bottom line is: if you can set it by using the wizard, you can probably modify it.<br>
	If everything is fine, it will be like this:<br>
	<img src="webconf_allgood.png" /><br>
	Once you hit the button, you'll be presented with a form with various stuff you can change. It is assumed you already run the wizard so you know what you're doing.<br>
	<img src="webconfig-form.gif" /><br>
	<em>Wait! Wouldn't it be better to let me see the values first?</em><br>
	Yes it would but it isn't. Maybe this feature will work in the future.<br>
